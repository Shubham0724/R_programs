### Functions: seq, paste, rep

?seq # starting with the seq function

seq() # just using the default settings

# simple sequence from 3 to 5

seq(3, 5)

seq(from = 3, to = 5)

# using length

seq(from = 3, length = 3)

# step manipulations

seq(from = 3, length = 3, by = 0.5)

seq(from = 3, by = 0.5, length = 3) # changed order
